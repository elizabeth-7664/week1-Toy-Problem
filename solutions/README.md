Prerequisites

  Node.js installed on your machine.

  Basic knowledge of JavaScript.

Challenges

1. Student Grade Generator

This program prompts the user to input student marks (0 - 100) and assigns a grade based on the following criteria:

A: Above 79

B: 60 - 79

C: 50 - 59

D: 40 - 49

E: Below 40

2. Speed Detector

This program takes a car's speed as input and evaluates it:

  If speed < 70: Outputs "Ok".

  For every 5 km/h above 70, one demerit point is added.

  If demerit points exceed 12: Outputs "License suspended".

3. Net Salary Calculator

This program calculates an individual's net salary based on:

  Basic salary and benefits.

  Deductions including PAYE (tax), NHIF, and NSSF.

4. Bubble Sort Algorithm

This program sorts an array of numbers in ascending order using the Bubble Sort algorithm.

5. Staircase Pattern Generator

This function prints a step-shaped staircase using the # symbol based on an integer input.

Example for steps(3):

#
##
###

6. Cylinder Volume Calculation

This program calculates the volume of a cylinder using the formula:

V = πr²h

The result is rounded to four decimal places.

How to Run the Code

1.Clone the repository:

 git clone [your-repo-url]

2.Navigate to the project folder:

 cd week1-toy-problems

3.Run a specific solution using Node.js:

 node filename.js

Replace filename.js with the actual file name for each challenge.
